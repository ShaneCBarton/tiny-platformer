# 🌀 Puzzle Platformer | Unity 6 Portfolio Project

A short but highly polished **puzzle platformer / obstacle course** game inspired by **Captain Toad** and **Fall Guys**, built in **Unity 6** using the vibrant and modular **Platformer Pack from KayKit**. Designed as a **portfolio piece** to showcase level design, gameplay polish, and visual presentation.

## 🎮 About the Game

In this compact 3D platforming experience, players navigate quirky and colorful levels full of:

- **Environmental puzzles**
- **Moving platforms**
- **Obstacle-based challenges**
- **Collectibles and secrets**

The game emphasizes fun movement, vibrant visuals, and clean game feel.

> Think of it as a mix between the level design of *Captain Toad* and the goofy obstacle course feel of *Fall Guys*, wrapped in a clean and playful art style.
